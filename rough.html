    <p>so	on	through	a	great	succession	of	towers	and	wires	until	the	request	reaches
 one	of	the	true	masters	of	time,	a	Network	Time	Server	run	by	or	referenced
 against	the	atomic	clocks	kept	at	places	like	the	National	Institute	of	Standards
 and	Technology	in	the	United	States,	the	Federal	Institute	of	Meteorology	and
 Climatology	in	Switzerland,	and	the	National	Institute	of	Information	and
 Communications	Technology	in	Japan.	That	long	invisible	journey,
 accomplished	in	a	fraction	of	a	second,	is	why	you	don’t	see	a	blinking	12:00	on
 your	phone’s	screen	every	time	you	power	it	up	again	after	its	battery	runs	out.
 I	was	born	in	1983,	at	the	end	of	the	world	in	which	people	set	the	time	for
 themselves.	That	was	the	year	that	the	US	Department	of	Defense	split	its
 internal	system	of	interconnected	computers	in	half,	creating	one	network	for	the
 use	of	the	defense	establishment,	called	MILNET,	and	another	network	for	the
 public,	called	the	Internet.</p>
 
 
 <p>Before	the	year	was	out,	new	rules	defined	the
 boundaries	of	this	virtual	space,	giving	rise	to	the	Domain	Name	System	that	we
 still	use	today—the.govs,	.mils,.edus,	and,	of	course,.coms—and	the	country
 codes	assigned	to	the	rest	of	the	world:.uk,	.de,	.fr,	.cn,	.ru,	and	so	on.	Already,
 my	country	(and	so	I)	had	an	advantage,	an	edge.	And	yet	it	would	be	another
 six	years	before	the	World	Wide	Web	was	invented,	and	about	nine	years	before
 my	family	got	a	computer	with	a	modem	that	could	connect	to	it.
 Ofjjuuuigiugigigiugigigiigiigiggiggiig	course,	the	Internet	is	not	a	single	entity,	although	we	tend	to	refer	to	it	as
 if	it	were.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>technical	reality	is	that	there	are	new	networks	born	every	day	on
 the	global	cluster	of	interconnected	communications	networks	that	you—and
 about	three	billion	other	people,	or	roughly	42	percent	of	the	world’s	population
 —use	regularly.	Still,	I’m	going	to	use	the	term	in	its	broadest	sense,	to	mean	the
 universal	network	of	networks	connecting	the	majority	of	the	world’s	computers
 to	one	another	via	a	set	of	shared	protocols.
 Some	of	you	may	worry	that	you	don’t	know	a	protocol	from	a	hole	in	the
 wall,	but	all	of	us	have	made	use	of	many.</p>
 
 
<p >Think	of	protocols	as	languages	for
 machines,	the	common	rules	they	follow	to	be	understood	by	one	another.	If
 you’re	around	my	age,	you	might	remember	having	to	type	the	“http”	at	the
 beginning	of	a	website’s	address	into	the	address	bar	of	your	Web	browser.	This
 refers	to	the	Hypertext	Transfer	Protocol,	the	language	you	use	to	access	the
 World	Wide	Web,	that	massive	collection	of	mostly	text-based	but	also	audio
and	video-capable	sites	like	Google	and	YouTube	and	Facebook.</p>	


<p>Every	time	you
 check	your	email,	you	use	a	language	like	IMAP	(Internet	Message	Access
 Protocol),	SMTP	(Simple	Mail	Transfer	Protocol),	or	POP3	(Post	Office
 Protocol).	File	transfers	pass	through	the	Internet	using	FTP	(File	Transfer protocol).</p>

    These	seafaring	ancestors	of	mine	sailed	down	the	coast	from	what’s	now
 Massachusetts	to	Connecticut	and	New	Jersey—plying	trade	routes	and	dodging
 pirates	between	the	Colonies	and	the	Caribbean—until,	with	the	Revolutionary
 War,	the	Jocelin	line	settled	in	North	Carolina.
 Amaziah	Jocelin,	also	spelled	Amasiah	Josselyn,	among	other	variants,	was	a
 privateer	and	war	hero.	</p>
 <p>	captain	of	the	ten-gun	barque	The	Firebrand,	he	was
 credited	with	the	defense	of	Cape	Fear.	Following	American	independence,	he
 became	the	US	Navy	Agent,	or	supply	officer,	of	the	Port	of	Wilmington,	where
 he	also	established	the	city’s	first	chamber	of	commerce,	which	he	called,
 funnily	enough,	the	Intelligence-Office.	The	Jocelins	and	their	descendants—the
 Moores	and	Halls	and	Meylands	and	Howells	and	Stevens	and	Restons	and
 Stokleys—who	comprise	the	rest	of	my	mother’s	side	fought	in	every	war	in	my
 country’s	history,	from	the	Revolution	and	the	Civil	War	(in	which	the
 Carolinian	relatives	fought	for	the	Confederacy	against	their	New
 England/Union	cousins),	to	both	world	wars.	Mine	is	a	family	that	has	always
 answered	the	call	of	duty.</p>

 <p>
 My	maternal	grandfather,	whom	I	call	Pop,	is	better	known	as	Rear	Admiral
 Edward	J.	Barrett.	At	the	time	of	my	birth	he	was	deputy	chief,	aeronautical
 engineering	division,	Coast	Guard	Headquarters,	Washington,	DC.	He’d	go	on	to
 hold	various	engineering	and	operational	commands,	from	Governors	Island,
 New	York	City,	to	Key	West,	Florida,	where	he	was	director	of	the	Joint
 Interagency	Task	Force	East	(a	multiagency,	multinational	US	Coast	Guard–led
 force	dedicated	to	the	interdiction	of	narcotics	trafficking	in	the	Caribbean).	I
 wasn’t	aware	of	how	high	up	the	ranks	Pop	was	rising,	but	I	knew	that	the
 welcome-to-command	ceremonies	became	more	elaborate	as	time	went	on,	with
 longer	speeches	and	larger	cakes.</p>
 
 <p>I	remember	the	souvenir	I	was	given	by	the
 artillery	guard	at	one	of	them:	the	shell	casing	of	a	40mm	round,	still	warm	and
 smelling	like	powdered	hell,	which	had	just	been	fired	in	a	salute	in	Pop’s	honor.
 Then	there’s	my	father,	Lon,	who	at	the	time	of	my	birth	was	a	chief	petty
 officer	at	the	Coast	Guard’s	Aviation	Technical	Training	Center	in	Elizabeth
 City,	working	as	a	curriculum	designer	and	electronics	instructor.	He	was	often
 away,	leaving	my	mother	at	home	to	raise	my	sister	and	me.	To	give	us	a	sense
of	responsibility,	she	gave	us	chores;	to	teach	us	how	to	read,	she	labeled	all	our
 dresser	drawers	with	their	contents—SOCKS,	UNDERWEAR.	</p>	
 
 
 
 <p>	load	us	into
 our	Red	Flyer	wagon	and	tow	us	to	the	local	library,	where	I	immediately	made
 for	my	favorite	section,	the	one	that	I	called	“Big	Masheens.”	Whenever	my
 mother	asked	me	if	I	was	interested	in	any	specific	“Big	Masheen,”	I	was
 unstoppable:	“Dump	trucks	and	steamrollers	and	forklifts	and	cranes	and—”
 “Is	that	all,	buddy?”
 “Oh,”	I’d	say,	“and	also	cement	mixers	and	bulldozers	and—”
 My	mother	loved	giving	me	math	challenges.	At	Kmart	or	Winn-Dixie,	she’d
 have	me	pick	out	books	and	model	cars	and	trucks	and	buy	them	for	me	if	I	was
 able	to	mentally	add	together	their	prices.	Over	the	course	of	my	childhood,	she
 kept	escalating	the	difficulty,	first	having	me	estimate	and	round	to	the	nearest
 dollar,	then	having	me	figure	out	the	precise	dollar-and-cents	amount,	and	then
 having	me	calculate	3	percent	of	that	amount	and	add	it	on	to	the	total.	I	was
 confused	by	that	last	challenge—not	by	the	arithmetic	so	much	as	by	the
 reasoning.	“Why?”</p>


 <p>“It’s	called	tax,”	my	mother	explained.	“Everything	we	buy,	we	have	to	pay
 three	percent	to	the	government.”
 “What	do	they	do	with	it?”
 “You	like	roads,	buddy?	You	like	bridges?”	she	said.	“The	government	uses
 that	money	to	fix	them.	They	use	that	money	to	fill	the	library	with	books.”
 Some	time	later,	I	was	afraid	that	my	budding	math	skills	had	failed	me,
 when	my	mental	totals	didn’t	match	those	on	the	cash	register’s	display.	But
 once	again,	my	mother	explained.	“They	raised	the	sales	tax.	Now	you	have	to
 add	four	percent.”<p>


 <p>“So	now	the	library	will	get	even	more	books?”	I	asked.
 “Let’s	hope,”	my	mother	said.
 My	grandmother	lived	a	few	streets	over	from	us,	across	from	the	Carolina
 Feed	and	Seed	Mill	and	a	towering	pecan	tree.	After	stretching	out	my	shirt	to
 make	a	basket	to	fill	with	fallen	pecans,	I’d	go	up	to	her	house	and	lie	on	the
 carpet	beside	the	long	low	bookshelves.	My	usual	company	was	an	edition	of
 Aesop’s	Fables	and,	perhaps	my	favorite,	Bulfinch’s	Mythology.	I	would	leaf
 through	the	pages,	pausing	only	to	crack	a	few	nuts	while	I	absorbed	accounts	of
 flying	horses,	intricate	labyrinths,	and	serpent-haired	Gorgons	who	turned
 mortals	to	stone. I	was	in	awe	of	Odysseus,	and	liked	Zeus,	Apollo,	Hermes,	and
 Athena	well	enough,	but	the	deity	I	admired	most	had	to	be	Hephaestus:	the	ugly
 god	of	fire,	volcanoes,	blacksmiths,	and	carpenters,	the	god	of	tinkerers.</p>
